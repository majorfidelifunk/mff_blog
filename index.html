            <b>Hello Friend!</b><br><br>

            My name is <b>Heiko</b>. I work as a Software-Developer/IT-Consultant in a small company in Germany, for about 5 years. 
            I love dancing, go to concerts, longboarding, spending time with my love, friends and family. But most importantly I am a fulltime-idiot! ü§°
